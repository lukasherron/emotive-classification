# emotive-classification

This repository contains:

* Testing function located in test.ipynb
* Training script located in train.ipynb
* Preprocessing script in preprocessing.ipynb (Note: for test.ipynb the preprocessing steps are already included)
* Report as report.pdf

Some non-standard libraries that may be required is:
* torch
* torchvision
* torchaudio

To run the test script, the saved networks should be in the same directory as the test.ipynb file. Otherwise the paths to the saved networks in test.ipynb must be changed.

Due to GitHub's upload size limit of 100MB, and the fact that each of network are 102MB, the networks may be downloaded from my UF Drobox with the following link:
